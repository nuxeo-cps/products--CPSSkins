CPSSkins default profile
------------------------

This profile is an extension profile that installs the CPSSkins
application. It is intended for the CPS 3.5 series, in which the default
rendering engine (installed by the CPSDefault:default profile)
is CPSDesignerThemes.

It presupposes that CPSDefault has already been set up and will turn
off CPSDesignerThemes.
With time, it's expected that more and more stuff will move from
CPSDefault:default to this profile
