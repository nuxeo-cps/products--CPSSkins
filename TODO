  * deleting cell stylers, cell hiders
  * moving cells

Refactoring:

- move the Page Blocks into Pages to be able to use Page renderers that share
  the same styles. Right now an entire Theme must be duplicated in order to
  display different page layouts:


            Theme                            Theme
              |                                |
      ----------------       ==>       -----------------
     |                |               |        |        |
  Page block        Styles          Page     Page       |
                                      |        |        |
                                    Page     Page     Styles
                                    Block    Block


  - dissociate between the notions of Theme renderer and Page renderer
  - There should be a default Page in every Theme
  - a Page can be displayed using ?theme=ThemeID&page=PageID
  - local themes / pages can be refered to as 'ThemeID+PageID'

  - theme migration / theme rebuild: move Page Blocks into a default Page if
    none exists.

- make the macroless renderer more intelligent so that it uses DIVs instead
of TABLEs whenever possible. The use cases are:

  - page blocks with only one column
  - page blocks with fixed columns widths
