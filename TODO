- Redesign the theme editor interface to separate the edit forms
  from the theme edition canvas. This is meant to remove the dependency
  on the main master slot, simplify navigation and improve responsiveness.

- use popups for editing theme objects instead of relying on inline edit forms

- unify the theme editor interface and the portlet editor (reuse components)

- use a single page for editing themes (e.g. cpsskins_theme_manage_form)
  with different panels.
