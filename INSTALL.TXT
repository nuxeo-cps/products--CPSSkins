Requirements:

      http://zope.org/Members/tseaver/CMFActionIcons


How to upgrade:

    See UPGRADE.TXT 



A) INSTALLATION THROUGH THE ZOPE MANAGEMENT INTERFACE

  In /Control_Panel/Products
  - Make sure that the 'CPSSkins' product is correctly installed 
    (i.e. not broken)

  From the Products' list add "CPSSkins Installer"


  IMPORTANT:

- Select the basic skin. It must be a skin that works already without CPSSkins.
  It is usually called 'Basic' in CMF, CPS2 and CPS3, or 'Plone Default' 
  in Plone.

- The type of portal (CMF/CPS2/CPS3/Plone/Plone2) is automatically detected.
  If the installation fails, make sure that the portal was correctly detected.
  Look for a 'Detected portal type is ...' message at the beginning of 
  the installation log.

- Check the 'reinstall default themes' option to reinstall the default themes.
  (BEWARE: existing themes created with CPSSkins will be erased)
  Default themes will be installed if this is a first installation.



B) INSTALLATION WITH CMFQUICKINSTALLER:

   CMF:
   - Go to 'portal_quickinstaller'
   - Select 'CPSSkins' and click on 'Install'

   Plone2:
   - Go to 'Plone Setup'
   - Choose 'Add/Remove Products'
   - Select 'CPSSkins'
   - Click on 'Install'

   CPSSkins can be also be uninstalled with CMFQuickInstaller


Have fun!
