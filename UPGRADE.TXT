UPGRADING from CPSSkins 2.2 to 2.3

* in the Portal Box Shape style the 'font weight' property has been replaced
  with 'font'.

  Instead of 'normal' or 'bold' use for instance:
  'bold 10pt Arial'


* Theme layouts now have "pages". Each theme can have several pages that
  share the same styles, palettes, images, etc ...

  To set up the new layout architecture, run:
  - 'cpsskinsupdate' (see above)

  Then to upgrade existing themes, run:
  - 'cpsskinsmigrate' (see above)

  Existing themes can also be upgraded to the new theme format by using the
  'Rebuild' option in the 'portal_themes' tool.

  Imported themes need not be upgraded since they are automatically rebuilt.
