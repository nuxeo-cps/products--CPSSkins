(2) Under Zope 2.7.x it is recommended to apply the following patches:
    http://zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1436 (fixes a severe memory leak)

    Optionally set the 'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'
    in the 'etc/zope.conf' configuration file.

    The leak will have been fixed in Zope-2.7.3 (not released at the time
    of this writing)

(3) The RAM cache can be used in a ZEO environment, however deleted 
    theme objects that have entries in the cache will not be automatically
    cleaned and will reside in RAM unless the cache orphans are manually
    removed.

(4) CMFActionIcons is included in CMF 1.5.

(5) Localizer is included in CPS2, CPS3 and Plone 1.
