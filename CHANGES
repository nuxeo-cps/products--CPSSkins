Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- #1826 : "CPSSkins selector panels can't be closed if one doesn't want to
  select a proposed choice".
- Setting the text inputs size to a bigger size than their actual display size
  so that they are more usable especially when setting font definitions which
  are very long.
- Fixed XHTML validity : "onClick" is not a valid attribute, one should use
  "onclick".
